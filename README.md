# SQL Portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository showcases examples of SQL scripts and queries I've created while working on solo projects and completing data analytics courses. These projects demonstrate my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, and generating insights from diverse datasets.  

I also use Tableau to visualize data and present insights. You can check out my Tableau Public profile here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/izabela.dudziak/vizzes

Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions or feedback. I'm always open to learning and improving!
